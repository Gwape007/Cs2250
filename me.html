    <header> <h4 id="heading"> A background on me and my nicknames</h4> </header>

    <p class="font1"> My name is Diego A. Perez-Carlos, I am a first generation college student raised in Watsonville California. Over the course of my life I have had various nicknames which changed and influenced how I would refer or name myself in different
        areas. When I was in elemtary I was called 007 in school has at the time one of my peers was also named Diego and I was really into the whole secret spy thing. I was called 007 for a while and made it my identity for a while however I didn't 
        spell it correctly as instead of writing 007 I wrote W007 adding a W and never fixed nor realized until much after that faze of my life had passed. This was my at school name while my cousins would refer to me at "Titobee" 
        which I would never find out where or why. Instead of being refered as Diego either of these were what I was called by my friends and cousins for the first part of my life which lead to me adopting Titobee007 as an ign (in game name). I would 
        use the name for different accounts and emails and currently my main email is still using name as its something that I believe to be apart of me. More recently I started to move away from the Titobee007 alias and started to move into using the 
        Alias "Gwape" as its a much more simple name. I came by this nickname kinda on my own as I was starting to grow tired of people not saying Titobee correctly which had me go through a couple of months switching names until I reached Gwape which
        is just Grape with the r switched out with a W to kinda give reference to my mistake earlier in my life with 007. I did chose this name because I was eating Grapes and had gotten tired of the temporay name on my account of the time and it stuck
        which is why most of my account names were Switched to Gwape. I also sometimes add a 007 if needed due to someone already have an account with Gwape as their username. Music has also played a huge role in my life and I have a very wide taste of
        music from corridos to metal and Jpop as well. Music to me is way of expression and has led me to recently try learning to play bass.

    <header><h4 id="heading"> Watsonville</h4></header>
<p class ="font1"> My hometown of Watsonville California is a mainly Mexican//Latin american dominated town were the main source of jobs is strawberry farming. The biggest of the Berry companies is called Driscols. I grew up in this small town which is something I never expected to change. Moving to Pomona has been very different 
    than what I'm used to espeically since its the first time I'm away from any of my family for an extended period of time. The town of Watsonville is very small time feeling and over the course of my life I have built connections with various store owners which
    is something that I heavliy took for granted. One of the shops I frequently visted called Santa Rosa Market was where my friends and I would go for lunch since it was good food for a fair price. The store was locally owned and the hefa was a very kind lady. I remeber when 
    there was a protest going on which envolved a lot of locally owned bussiness closing for the day my friends and I didn't realize it was happening when we arrived however the owner says us walk up and start leaving then proceeded to stop us and invite us in to get food and
    explained why they were closed. She didn't charge us and we all just talked for a while before we headed back to school. Recently when I went back to pick up some meat I ended up being reconized and talking with the owner and it didn't really occur how much of a connection I had 
    made with the people at Santa Rosa Market. Its not just there as its the case for a couple other places and the small town feeling is something I can alway appericate. Fun fact Watsonville is south of Santa Cruz and North of Monterey.
