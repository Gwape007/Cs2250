        <h3 id="heading"> This page is just the main page of the website which will help explain what to expect with the various
            other links and pages on the site.
        </h3>
        
        <p class="font1"> The Website is currently split into 5 different tabs. The first tab is the main page(this one) which
            because I have no clue what to write or add is just a temporay void or hub until I can think of how to
            incorporate a better <br> hub.
            The second page is simply a funny youtube video that has no other purpose rather than showing a funny
            thing. I will change it to something more useful like a "About me" page but currently its just a filler
            page without anything real purpose
            The third page shows what songs Spotify currently says I'm currently is reapeating the most since Music
            is a big aspect in my life and I always have something playing. The fourth path ways leads to a gimmick
            account that again I believe to be a fun joke that gives "updates" to the earth in a format that is
            simlar to a game giving patch notes to update their game. The final page is the about me
            page which is where I am gonna discuss a little bit about me and a bit about my background. The rest of
            this main page is just gonna be dedicated to a couple
            <br> of books and some songs I am listening to at the moment.

                    <summary> Eighty-six 86 by ASATO ASATO</summary>
                    <p class="size1"> The world of Eighty-six is something that I have been following for the past two years and over the
                        course of 11 current books I do not regret the journey going through and reading it. The story <br>
                        itself is a great scifi series that plays off themes of equality and discriminations in a way that
                        really makes you think about how some people with certain values really act while giving a nice mix
                        of <br>
                        action and subtle more hard themes like racism or having to find a reason to live. I still am eager
                        to pick up each new volume of the series when it comes out and seeing where the story takes the
                        characters.

                    <summary>Goblin Slayer by Kumo Kagyu</summary>
                    <p class="size1">This yet another series I have been reading for a long time and for its credit started off in a
                        really cruel and off putting way however sticking with the story itself was something I did not
                        regret.
                        The story is a purely fantasy setting with the main character carry trama leaving him with only want
                        to end goblins and showing no interest in anything other. The series for its part moves into
                        something I didn't
                        expect which was growth in the character known as Goblin Slayer and the people he meets and starts
                        to get along with on the way. Something intersting about this series is that no character is given
                        names and rather
                        called by their roles, a couple of examples are: Goblin Slayer, Priestest, Dwarf, Guild girl, Lizard
                        Priest.

                <summary>Sisyphus II by Ibrahim</summary>
                <p class="size1"> Sisyphus II is a song that has a lot of reference to different mythologies which is why I really
                    enjoy it. Paired with the beat and the smooth transitions and the the song being a play on the
                    Sisyphus who for eternatiy having to push a bolder for it to rest
                    then going to to saying the person in the song is the having to replay their time alive and each
                    setnence is something they have done in order to try and break the eternal loop they are in
                    captivated me and is why its one of my favorite songs.

                <summary>Laydown by Priestest</summary>
                <p class="size1"> This is a banger of a song which is something that I keep in my rock and roll playlist. I found this
                    song on a whim and have enjoyed it eversince. The rythm of the song really gives an energetic feel
                    and I feel is a great song just to jam out to while doing
                    anything to keep focus. The song lyrics isn't as deep as Sisyphus however it doesn't take away from
                    the sound of the song.
